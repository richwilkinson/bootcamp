Bootcamp Refactor HW
Grouped some css selectors, fixed a background img in css.
Fixed the first link that was missing id tag.
added some styled fonts in p tags.
I added title tags to all photos and link to display what user is viewing.
I added a pseudo class to add a different color to background and text when highlighted & cool color buttons that change when hovered and pressed :).
I added a <nav>, <aside>, <article>, <main> & <section> where appropriate.
